"""Pure-function module for Claude API cost estimation.

Prices are expressed as USD per million tokens. Values reflect public
Anthropic pricing as of July 2026 (verify at https://www.anthropic.com/pricing).
The module has no side effects aside from emitting a ``warnings.warn`` when
callers request an unknown model (in which case we silently fall back to
Sonnet pricing so billing never crashes a running collector).

Cache rates follow the standard Anthropic formula:
    cache_read     = input_rate × 0.1   (10% of input cost for reads)
    cache_creation = input_rate × 1.25  (25% markup for cache writes)
